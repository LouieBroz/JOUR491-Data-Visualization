#Make your Excel charts Tufte compliant

This document is largely inspired by [QUNB](http://insights.qunb.com/good-ol-excel-is-the-ultimate-data-visualization-tool-in-most-cases/) with a few twists and turns. 

1. Delete the legend, the horizontal gridlines and the Y axis.
2. Double-click on each category then in the “Fill” menu: change to color; in the “Line” menu: apply the same color; in the “Shadow” menu: disable the “shadow” option.
3. Double-click on the x axis, then in the “Ticks” menu: select “Major Tick Mark Type” [none]; in the “Fill” menu: change Color from [Automatic] to [No Fill]; in the “Line” menu : change Color from [Automatic] to [no Line]. Then tweak the x axis labels to fit your publication style: Change the font, enlarge the font, change the font color.
4. Add data labels by right clicking on each level and going to “Add Data Labels”. Change the font to match other fonts, the font size to fit, and the font color for readability.
5. Add labels. QUNB has a way with deleting some extraneous data labels and then moving renamed labels to the right. That works in certain instances. What also works is adding the legend back in (click chard layout and click Legend and add it at the right). You can then stretch the legend to match colors to their physical location on the graphic so they line up better. What you do will depend on your data.
