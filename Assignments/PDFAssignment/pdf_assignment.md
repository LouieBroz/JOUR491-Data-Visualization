# PDF Assignment

1. Open the PDF in this folder. Look at it. Hate it. Because whoever made it clearly hates you by junking it up with so much stuff.
2. Your task is to get this out of a PDF and into a useable data file. To do this, you must: 

    * Get it out of a PDF
    * Remove extraneous headers
    * Remove extraneous footers
    * Preserve the College each major is housed in
    * Export it as a CSV
    
3. After you have done this, use Agate to show me a list of the 20 most common majors on campus.
