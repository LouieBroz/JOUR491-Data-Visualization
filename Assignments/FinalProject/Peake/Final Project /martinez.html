        	<h2>Taylor Martinez Career Information</h2>
       	
                
           	<p>After only playing in four games during his senior campaign, Taylor Martinez has benen inactive for the rest of the regular season. Martinez was 25 yards off of becoming the second quarterback in the country to pass for over 9000 yards and rush for over 3000 yards in a career since Colin Kaeperneck. Martinez spent the past three seasons re-writing the Nebraska statistical record book. Martinez has started a quarterback school-record 39 games at Nebraska, and the 6-1, 210-pound Martinez has used his dual-threat abilities to torment opposing defenses and lead Nebraska to three straight seasons of at least nine wins.

As a junior, Martinez started all 14 games and set Nebraska season records with 3,890 yards of total offense and 33 total touchdowns. Martinez also showed his poise and leadership in the clutch, guiding Nebraska to four victories after trailing by double-digit deficits in the second half. His outstanding play earned Martinez first-team All-Big Ten honors from the Big Ten coaches and second-team accolades by the media. He was also named Nebraska’s Team and Offensive MVP for his standout junior campaign.

His 2,871 yards passing were the most ever for a Nebraska junior and the third-best overall total in NU history. After a strong offseason of work on his passing mechanics, Martinez completed better than 62 percent of his throws in 2012, an improvement of nearly six percent. He also connected on 23 touchdown passes. On the ground, Martinez rushed for 1,019 yards, which ranked as the fourth-best single-season total in school history for a quarterback.

Martinez enters his senior season with a school-record 9,449 yards of total offense in his career, easily surpassing the previous record of 7,915 yards by 2001 Heisman Trophy winner Eric Crouch. The 9,449 yards of total offense is third among returning players in the FBS ranks. Martinez’s 6,591 career passing yards are also a Nebraska career record.

In the running game, Martinez is the nation’s leading returning rusher with 2,858 yards on 545 career rushes, an average of 5.2 yards per carry. Martinez is second in school history among quarterbacks in rushing yards, trailing only Crouch’s 3,434 yards. Martinez is also eighth overall in NU history in rushing yards and could move as high as No. 2 on that list this fall.

Beyond his school records, Martinez is a threat to put himself in elite categories in NCAA history. He is one of only six quarterbacks in the FBS ranks to post a 2,000-yard passing/1,000 yard rushing season in either 2011 or 2012.

Martinez is also in position to record 9,000 career passing yards and 3,000 rushing yards, needing 2,409 passing yards and 142 rushing yards to reach those figures. If he would accomplish that feat he would join Colin Kaepernick as the only players in FBS history to reach the 9,000/3,000 career mark. Martinez is already just the 12th player in FBS history to pass for 6,000 yards and rush for 2,500 yards in a career. He was one of only four players to reach that milestone before the end of their junior year, joining Kaepernick, Vince Young (Texas) and Brad Smith (Missouri).

An explosive athlete, Martinez holds Nebraska quarterback position testing records in the vertical jump, pro agility run and 10-yard dash.

Martinez is set to earn his undergraduate degree in ethnic studies this December. He will be joined on the 2013 Husker roster by his younger brother, Drake, who is expected to begin his Nebraska career in the secondary. *source www.Huskers.com</p>
