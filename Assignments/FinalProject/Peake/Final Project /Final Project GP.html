        	<h2>Martinez racked up a tremendous career while at Nebraska, leading the Huskers in most statistical categories for quarterbacks, but is he No.1 in our heart? </h2>
        	<p>Being a quarterback at a big time NCAA Division 1 school is no easy task, this can be found especially true at the University of Nebraska.
		Taylor Martinez has been without a doubt--the most scrutinized player in Nebraska history. With the developing trends on social media, it seems as if "new breaking news" is at
		everyones tips of their fingers. Martinez has been almost percieved by most to be a qb that can make exciting plays, but cannot win the big game.
		
		Well I am here to tell you that Martinez is not just a qb that can make big plays, Martinez should and will go down as one of the best quarterbacks to ever play at Nebraska. Even though
		'Tmagic' did never win a Conference Title, or even a National Championship, Martinez showed Husker Nation a tremendous show, including highs and lows that most likely not only had an affect on
		Martinez, but the team as well.</p>

       	  <h3>Tumultuous Career</h3>
       	  <p> Obviously I am not here to point fingers at anybody, but during Martinez's regime, especially early on, his game and his early career were filled with what seemed like 'media explosions' all around the country
	  about our Huskers. There was the incident that one night.... a dark.. dark... night, down in College Station. Where on National T.V., Brent Mustberger and Kurt Herbstriet on the call, Nebraska Head Coach Bo Pelini
	  had a tirade for the ages on Martinez. Story is, Martinez called his father in the locker room during a game to let him know his was feeling alright after a minor injury. Well in Pelini's world, that is a big, or... for advertising..
	  B1G mistake. Pelini was seen ripping apart Martinez during the game, clearly using profane language while also clearly losing his shit throughout the rest of the game.
	  
	  <p>My question to you is, if you are a 19 yearold redshirt freshman quarterback playing on National Television, with the wild-ass fan base that is Nebraska football behind you, and your
	  Head Coach 'father figure' rips you apart infront of everyone. How do you come back from that?</p>
	  
	  <p>Well, Taylor infact did comeback from that, even with a mentally unstable Head Coach by his side, giving the kid the highest highs and the lowest lows anyone could ever ask for came out and balled out for his team.
	  As you will see, Martinez will end his career at Nebraska leading most all statistical categories. Below you can see the selected group of quarterbacks that I compare with Martinez and his career. In my findings, i can tell you this
	  for sure... If we did not have Taylor Martinez playing during the past four years, Pelini might have had to skip town a lot earlier.</p>
